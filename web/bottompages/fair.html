  <p>The Indian Banksâ„¢ Association (IBA) has drafted and circulated a voluntary code, which sets the standards for fair practice standards when dealing with individual customers. As per the RBI Guidelines for Credit Cards, we have adopted and will implement this Code in our organization.<br>
    As a regulatory directed document, the Code promotes competition and encourages market forces to achieve higher operating standards to the benefit of the customers of SAHARACPSL. In the Code, 'you' denotes our credit card customer and 'we' denotes the Company SAHARACPSL. <br>
    The standards of the Code are governed by the four key commitments detailed in section 2.<br>
    Unless stated otherwise, all parts of this Code apply to all the credit card products and services, whether we provide them across the counter, over the phone, on the internet or by any other method.<br>
    Commitments outlined in this Code are applicable under normal operating environment. In the event of force majeure, we may not be able to fulfill the commitments under this Code.</p>
